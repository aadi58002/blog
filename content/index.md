<h1>âœŒ Hi there. I'm Aditya yadav</h1>  
<br/>
I am a <strong>hobbyist programmer</strong> who like to tinker around with whatever tool i find intersting  
and i want to see how far i can stretch the tool.  
I always like to admire the features people work hard to put in a piece of software.  

I also like the open source software in general.

This blog is my attempt to gather whatever i learn about as well as show what technologies i like to work with.
