This is source repository for my personal website as well as site to gather good resources for topic which interest me.

a static-site generator (SSG) with Vue3.

In order to start the live server or build the website (output goes to `dist`):

```bash
## Live server
pnpm run content:dev

## Build
pnpm run content:build
```
